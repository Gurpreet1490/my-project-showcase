# üìù My Project Showcase

Welcome to my project showcase.

Here are the highlights of my most notable projects.

---Project 2
## ‚úèÔ∏è Movie-Api (Group Project: https://github.com/debnon/Movie-API)

Purpose of this project was to build a fully functioning backend. We were asked create API endpoints using appropriate Http Verbs, unit tests, project should well documented and also using info endpoint to give the user information on how the application works and a /health endpoint to give the health of the application. 

We used spring as framework and Intelij as code editor. Both together, they are veryeasy to use, high productivity and one doesn‚Äôt have to worry about writing additional code. 

To build this project we followed MVC approach(Model, View and Controller) and we used this approach so that all project contributors can work simultaneously on the model, controller and views and it also involves low coupling among models, views or controllers and modification is easy.
 
We build this project to get movie recommendations based on inputted criteria, e.g. year/genre/actor/ratings/certification. This project allowed me learn alot like how to retrieve online data, how to generate JWT token for login credentials, how to bcrypt password. And i have learned from my team mates how to integrate online data with database. Also, we used twilio to send sms, so i have learned to config twilio in backend.  We have also implemented spring security to secure some endpoint like admin controller where no other user except admin has access. 


---Project 2
## ‚úèÔ∏è  MarsRover
  
Purpose of this project was to apply TDD approach to solve the problem. 
We were asked to move rovers around the surface of Mars. 
I have used Intellij as code editor and junit framework to implementing testing. 

I tried to follow TDD approach and used it to a certain extent.  I used this approach so that i can avoid writing unnecessary code. 

I created different classes, enum (for fixed values) and exception handling classes, e.g. i created Rover class which was use implement methods like turn left, right or move and which position rover has taken while landing etc. Also, main class to instruct rover to follow input provided in console (used scanner to get input). 

This assignment made me learn how to implement my own exception handling, separate of concern and usage of enum and also how to use switch condition. And how to create UML diagram. 

---Project 3
## ‚úèÔ∏è Cinnamon-Cinemas-TDD
  
Purpose of this project was to apply TDD approach to solve the kata.

We were asked to write well-designed and tested code representing real-world scenarios and evidence of Test-Driven Development being applied by doing regular commits. And requirement of this kata was has 15 seats, arranged in 3 rows of 5. Rows from A to C and seat number from 1 to 5. 

I have used intellij as code editor and junit framework for testing. 

I have followed the TDD approach, RGR (RED, green and refactor), wrote a failing test, made it passed and refactor the code if needed. Used act, arrange and assert approach to write ,my test). 

I have learned TDD approach, writing tests first to avoid writing unnecessary functional code.
